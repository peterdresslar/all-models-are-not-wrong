    "\n",
    "> \"All models are wrong. Some are useful.\"[^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This famous saying—promulgated by prominent twentieth-century statistician George Box—is one of the more widely-known commentaries on modeling discipline: so much so, that it has its own Wikipedia page.[^2] \n",
    "\n",
    "However, speaking at least from a contemporary perspective, one wonders how helpful it is to welcome new students and prospective pracitioners to an exploration in complexity science with such a quixotic passage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, is \"All models are wrong...\" useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">. . .</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get ahead of ourselves, it seems appropriate to discuss the context of the aphorism[^3] in which it was originally published.[^4] Here it is quoted from Box's book chapter, *Robustness in the Strategy of Scientific Model Building*, published in 1979. In the following quote, the capitalization and lack of internal punctuation are both taken from the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    ">ALL MODELS ARE WRONG BUT SOME ARE USEFUL ... Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world could be exactly represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations. For example, the law PV = RT relating pressure P, volume V and temperature T of an \"ideal\" gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it frequently provides a useful approximation and furthermore its structure is informative since it springs from a physical view of the behavior of gas molecules. For such a model there is no need to ask the question \"Is the model true?\". If \"truth\" is to be the \"whole truth\" the answer must be \"No\". The only question of interest is \"Is the model illuminating and useful?\".[^5] \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there are actually two seperate ideas hinted at in the discussion here. The first is the difficulty in replicating real-world conditions in the form of model math with absolute fidelity. The second is the idea that the value of a model is independent of such fidelity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these two ideas is developed at length in the chapter, though the latter one is tempered through rigorous discussion of methods for model \"Robustification.\"[^6] As Box was a statistician, those Robustification methods are unsurprisingly rooted deeply in analytical methods from that field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box would go on to utter the phrase in various forms at conferences and other fora, seemingly as sort of a \"catch phrase\" that caught on. In his writings and from the discussion of his life on his Wikipedia entry and other authors, it seems very clear that Box was both an iconoclast and—to leverage this author's lived experience—very much a man of his place and time. The pithiness of \"all models are wrong\" suited those places and times quite well. \n",
    "\n",
    "But places and times have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some academics have commented on the quotation over the years, with at least a few of them seeming to take a bit of issue with it.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Finally it does not seem helpful just to say that all models are wrong. The very word model implies simplification and idealization. The idea that complex physical, biological or sociological systems can be exactly described by a few formulae is patently absurd. The construction of idealized representations that capture important stable aspects of such systems is, however, a vital part of general scientific analysis...\" [^7]\n",
    "\n",
    "This commentary, by David Cox, appears in the commentary from a well-cited paper by Chris Chatfield called *Model Uncertainty, Data Mining and Statistical Inference.* Intriguingly, the comment appears to mix up elements of the Box discussion, given that Box actually refers to an \"idealized system\" in his prose. It would seem, perhaps, that Cox did not actually have access to the Box.[^8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, his point is well-taken. What else would models exist to do, except to translate the systems of the world around us into \"logical devices\" through which we can generate understanding and predictive ability? And if such models are providing such utility, to the degree that we are able to trust them, how could we call them wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly fifty years after Box's first coinage of the saying, we are unquestionably living in a new regime of thinking; or, by the estimate of some, a new regime of *un*-thinking. Readers will need little reminder of society's changing attitudes toward basic sciences and the nature of facts themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">...</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not Box's quotation is useful, it is certainly wrong.\n",

    "In their seminal textbook, *Individual-based Modeling and Ecology*, Grimm and Railsback iterate through the myriad challenges to be overcome by natural system models. They list errors in measurement, in assumptions, in effects fo time and space, and even (or especially) software errors, among many others, as hurdles to be cleared along the way. While they are clear-eyed, to say the least, about the effort required to develop faithful representations of the ecological world, they take a different approach in communicating this:\n",

Obviously, theories that have been tested and shown valid can contribute to better manage ment of the systems they address... When we closely link theory to management applications, we force our theory to solve specific problems; finding theory that solves specific problems is a productive path toward finding theory that is general in the sense of solving many problems.[^14]\n",

In this way, even directly counterfactual simulations can be used to \"bridge\" to more solid theoretical grounds in other ecological (or biological, or social, etc.,) systems.\n",
